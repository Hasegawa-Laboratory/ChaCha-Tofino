# ChaCha implementation on Tofino switches
This is a P4 implementation of ChaCha on Intel Tofino programmable switches. The original paper proposing this implementation has been accepted to appear in Euro P4 workshop, which will be held in conjunction with CoNEXT 2022. We will upload our code here after our paper is presented at the workshop.
